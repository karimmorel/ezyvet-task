# ezyVet task

Hello Marek :)<br/>
I just finished the task you sent me. I encapsulated the whole shopping cart logic in the CartService class (app/Services/CartService.php).<br/>
To initialize the project, you need to clone this repository locally and then run composer install.<br/>
You will may be have to copy the .env.example in the .env file, or generate the key (php artisan key:generate) to run the application.<br/>
The application must be accessible throught the <a href="http://localhost:80/ezyvet-task/public/">localhost/ezyvet-task/public</a> depending on your environment.<br/>
I used Laravel for this task, because I think it is giving me some tools to be more efficient and to do the task faster.<br/>
I tried to do it as I understood the task.
I did not focused on the front-end and the design of the html page, as requested.<br/>
I did not created a product entity because here the products are stored in the array, so I think it was not necessary.
Here the shopping cart is stored in session.<br/>

I hope it will interest you, there is not a lot of documentation in this ReadME file because it is a pretty small project, but if you have any question do not hesitate to contact me.
