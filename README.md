# ezyVet task

Hello Marek :)<br/>
I just finished the task you sent me. I encapsulated the whole shopping cart logic in the CartService class (app/Services/CartService.php).
I used Laravel for this task, because I think it is giving me some tools to be more efficient and to do the task faster.<br/>
I tried to do it as I understood the task.
I did not focused on the front-end and the design of the html page, as requested.<br/>
I did not created a product entity because here the products are stored in the array, so I think it was not necessary.
Here the shopping cart is stored in session.

I hope it will interest you, there is not a lot of documentation in this ReadME file because it is a pretty small project, but if you have any question do not hesitate to contact me.
